# CommentSearch.vim

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/gilsondev/searchtasks.vim
I wanted to better learn vimscript, and wanted to be able to exclude directories

## TODO

- Write README
- Write Help
- Add command to dynamically add more comment types on the fly
- Add command to dynamically add more excluded dirs on the fly
- Remove duplicates in vimgrep output
